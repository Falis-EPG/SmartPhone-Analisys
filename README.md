Smartphone Data Analysis and Visualization


Introduction:
This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing data on smartphone sales and prices. The data is provided in a CSV file named smartphone_data.csv. The code includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and creation of two informative visualizations.

Data Analysis
The code begins by loading the CSV file and performing basic data cleaning. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and identifying outliers.

Feature Engineering
Next, the code creates several new features from the existing data. These new features are designed to be more informative for the analysis.

Visualization
The code creates two visualizations to illustrate the key findings from the data analysis.

Visualization 1: Smartphone Sales by Brand
This visualization is a bar chart that shows the number of smartphones sold for each brand. The chart is labeled with the brand names and the number of smartphones sold for each brand.

Visualization 2: Average Smartphone Price by Brand
This visualization is a horizontal bar chart that shows the average smartphone price for each brand. The chart is labeled with the brand names and the average smartphone price for each brand.

Conclusion
The visualizations created in this code provide valuable insights into the smartphone sales data. The first visualization shows that some brands are significantly more popular than others. The second visualization shows that the average smartphone price varies widely by brand.

Additional Notes

The code is written in Python and requires the following libraries:
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
The CSV file smartphone_data.csv is assumed to be in the same directory as the Python code.
The visualizations are saved as PNG images in the same directory as the Python code.
